## 🎯 Purpose
SyllaScan is an AI-powered tool designed to help students stay on top of their academic responsibilities.
By uploading their syllabuses, students can leverage AI to automatically extract important dates, including:

- Deadlines for assignments and projects
- Quiz and exam schedules
- Important academic events

The extracted data is seamlessly integrated into Google Calendar, providing students with automated reminders and preparation notifications.
This ensures they have ample time to plan, study, and complete their coursework efficiently, reducing the risk of missing key deadlines.

Currently, SyllaScan works consistently with Google Calendar and regular iCal.
We are actively working on future updates to support additional platforms like Outlook, Notion, Sheets, and more.
